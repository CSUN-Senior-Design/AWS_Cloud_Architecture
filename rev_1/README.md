edited as of April 8 2020

files that were modified:
1) ec2.tf --> just some minor additions
2) elb.tf --> added asg and modified the elb to be alb
3) rds.tf --> just some minor fix
4) vpc.tf --> just some minor additions

Will still work on connectivity between alb and asg, hopefully I will revise it again by Monday April 13 2020. 
I will also need to clean the code more, there were still some extra codes that I no longer needed.
